    # Outwit and outbluff your opponents by playing your cards in an ascending order—real or fake. Build the pot, survive accusations, and walk away with the gold.

    # Setup
    # Deck: Standard 52-card deck.

    # Hands: Each player is dealt 5 cards.

    # Pot: Each player then antes 10 gold into the pot to begin the round.

    # Starting Card: Always begins with 5 as the “first claimed rank.”

    # Turn Rules
    # Player Action:

    # On your turn, play 1 card 'face-down' and declare it as the next value up in the sequence.

    # Example: Starting with 5, next player declares “6,” then “7,” etc.

    # You may lie.

    # Rank Progression:

    # Claimed values go up: 5 → 6 → 7 → … → Ace

    # Calling “Liar”:

    # Any player may call “Liar!” immediately after a card is played.

    # If the card matches the declared rank: The caller was wrong.
    # → The pot goes to the called player

    # If the card does not match the declared rank: The liar is caught.
    # → The caller takes the entire pot.

    # Round resets after a Liar call (everyone re-antes).

    # End-of-Round Reset:

    # If any player runs out of cards, the round ends.
    # → Pot is split evenly among the players.

    # New round begins with another ante, fresh cards, and reset starting claim (5).""")
