[secrets]

# List of locations where secrets are searched.
# An entry can be a path to a TOML file or directory path where
# Kubernetes style secrets are saved. Order is important, import is
# first to last, so secrets in later files will take precedence over
# earlier ones.
# Default: [ <path to local environment's secrets.toml file>, <path to project's secrets.toml file>,]
